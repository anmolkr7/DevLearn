To create a react app you usually need to worry about two things
Creators of frontend framework realised that all websites can effectively be divided into two parts:
1. State:
An object that represents the current state of the app . It represents the dynamic things in your app
(things that change) eg:-value of counter
State is a built-in React feature that allows components to remember and manage data between renders.
It determines how a component behaves and what it displays.

2. Components
How a DOM element should render, given a state as input
It is re-usable,dynamic ,HTML snippet that changes given the state as input
Eg:- Button is component. It takes the state(currentCount) as an input and is supposed to render
accordingly

Re-Rendering:- A state change triggers a re-render.
A re-render represents the actual DOM being manipulated when the state changes

YOU USUALLY HAVE TO DEFINE ALL YOUR COMPONENTS ONCE AND THEN ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS UPDATE THE
STATE OF YOUR APP. REACT TAKES CARE OF RE-RENDERING YOUR APP
