/*
DOM- Document Object Model

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface(API) that represents an HTML or 
XML document as a tree structure made of objects, where each node represents an element, attribute, or 
piece of text.

When a browser loads an HTML document, it creates a structured representation of the 
document as a tree. Each HTML element becomes a node in this tree.
