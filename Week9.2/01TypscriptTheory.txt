TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the 
language. It was developed by Microsoft to make JavaScript development more scalable 
and maintainable. TypeScript compiles down to JavaScript, meaning it runs anywhere
JavaScript runs (browsers, Node.js, etc.).

Key Features:
Static Typing – Helps catch errors at compile time instead of runtime.
Interfaces & Type Annotations – Improves code readability and maintainability.
Modern JavaScript Features – Supports ES6+ features and compiles them for older environments.
Better Tooling Support – Works well with editors like VS Code, providing autocompletion, refactoring, and debugging.

Why Use TypeScript?
Fewer runtime errors due to type checking.
Improved developer experience with better IntelliSense and documentation.
Easier to maintain and scale in large codebases.

Where/How does typescript code run?
->TypeScript code never runs in your browser. Your browser can only understand 
JavaScript.
1.JavaScript is the runtime language (the thing that actually runs in your browser/node.js runtime)
2.typescript is something that compiles down to javascript.
3.When typescript is compiled down to javascript, you get type checking (similar to c++). 
If there is an error, the conversion to javascript fails.

Step 1
Write TypeScript code → script.ts

Step 2
Compile to JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler (tsc):
tsc script.ts

Result
This generates a JavaScript file (script.js).


Why TypeScript Needs Compilation:
1.TypeScript introduces types, interfaces, and features beyond JavaScript, 
which browsers don't understand.
2.The TypeScript compiler (tsc) converts it into plain JavaScript that browsers can execute.

Step 1-Install typescript globally
npm install -g typescript

Step 2-Initialize and empty folder and inside this folder
npm init -y     (Creates a package.json file)
tsc --init      (Creates a tsconfig.json file)


After you write some code in your example.ts file then compile it using tsc -b
this will give a example.js file automatically.
SO YOU HAVE TO RUN THIS JS FILE NOT TS FILE
