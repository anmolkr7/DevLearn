/*
Custom Hooks in React allow you to extract reusable logic from components, making your code 
more modular and readable. They are simply JavaScript functions that use 
built-in React Hooks (like useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.) inside them.

ðŸ“– Creating a Custom Hook
A custom hook follows the naming convention of starting with use (e.g., useFetch, useCounter).
