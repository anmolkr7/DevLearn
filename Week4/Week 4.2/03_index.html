<!-- In previous 02_index.html, the DOM used to be clear upfront whenever
 the server gave us new todos array
We need to not clear it upfront and rather update it based on what has changed
-->

<!-- Question is,How does it calculate what all has changed
Has a todo been marked as complete
has a todo been removed from the backend
Ans:- By remembering the old todos in a variable and then 
comparing with the new todos received from backend (VIRTUAL DOM) --> 

<!-- 
React:- ✅ Virtual DOM – Optimizes rendering performance
✅ State Management – Manages dynamic UI updates efficiently 
i.e calculates the diff-->

<!-- React DOM:-Tells react how to add/remove elements from DOM -->
